# longbeards

The Longbeards, were the most important clan of Dwarves. Their name comes from that of their first king, Durin I "The Deathless". They were the eldest and greatest of the seven Dwarf-clans.

They originally inhabited the Misty Mountains as a home, until they were driven out by Orcs. Their strongholds in the Misty Mountains included Khazad-dûm (Moria), their first city, and Mount Gundabad. During the Second Age, Durin's folk entered into friendship with the Noldor of Celebrimbor in Eregion. During the War of the Last Alliance, Durin's folk allied with the Elves and the Dúnedain.
